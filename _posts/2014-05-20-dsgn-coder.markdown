Dsgn coder is a personal blog about web development that I'm starting in 2014.

This project will bring stories of web development and tips & tricks from the view of a front-end Web Developer, focused on all things HTML, CSS and Javascript.

With the use of good front-end practices complying with modern web standards, we will embrace on a journey of web knowledge.
