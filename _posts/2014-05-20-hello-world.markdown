I’m a **BlackBerry enthusiast**, *front-end developer*, *web designer*, a creator of BerrySocialBr, Café com BlackBerry, Design Criativo, BBi Magazine, dsgn coder, a curator of BlackBerry Por Escolha particularly excited by Firefox OS.

Dsgn Coder is a *personal blog about web development* that I'm starting in 2014.

This project will bring stories of web development from the view of a front-end Web Developer, focused on all things HTML, CSS and Javascript.

With the use of good front-end practices complying with modern web standards, we will embrace on a journey of web knowledge.
